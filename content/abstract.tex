Research in numerical methods for partial differential equations is a dynamic field, as evidenced by a steady output of high-impact publications. Key areas of focus include discretization schemes, high-dimensional PDE techniques, and data-driven solution methods.

This thesis investigates the discontinuous GalÃ«rkin method for the space-time discretization of a particular class of PDEs.

The method is first introduced for the broader class of parabolic problems and later specialized to the convection-diffusion-reaction problem, for which an explicit derivation and error analysis are carried out. The algorithm, along with all its components, such as a mesher and a linear solver for sparse systems, is then implemented from scratch in \lstinline{C++23}, and this implementation is used for numerical testing.

Numerical tests performed in both the parabolic and hyperbolic cases, where the diffusion constant $\Diffusion$ is equal to $0$, validate the algorithm and its implementation, confirming the expected orders of convergence for the error derived in the theoretical analysis across various norms.

The results obtained not only confirm the effectiveness of this approach but also lay the groundwork for future research, particularly in the direction of adaptivity.
